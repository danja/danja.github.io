<strong>In Brief</strong> : I'm a <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">Semantic Web</a> developer and <a href="#published">technical author</a> specializing in cutting-edge
technologies. I have a <a href="http://dannyayers.com/">weblog</a> and am fond
of <a href="http://dannyayers.com/archives/cat_nice_looking_creatures.html">animals</a>.

<p><strong>Availability :</strong> I'm usually available for development work
on anything interesting (pretty much any programming language), as long as I
can do it from home. I'm also prepared to write about virtually anything, for
reasonable recompense. Likewise I'll be happy to speak anywhere on just about
anything, assuming expenses are covered. The best way to contact me is by
email: <a href="mailto:danny.ayers@gmail.com">danny.ayers@gmail.com</a></p>
</div>

<h3>Current Activities</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Programming, R&amp;D</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Ongoing activities include experimenting with an agile approach to
Semantic Web application development. Near the top of my to-do list is <a href="http://pragmatron.org/">Pragmatron</a>, the umbrella name for a set of
Personal Knowledge Management tools, which I hope before long will be able to
look after my to-do lists. I recently got involved in the <a href="http://www.gargonza.org/">Gargonza Experiment</a>, which aims to
produce cool demos of Semantic Web technologies, particularly using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/">SPARQL Query Language for
RDF</a>. A part of the Pragmatron project was suitable for this (RSS/Atom
aggregation bits), so I've recently been concentrating on that with the
working title <a href="http://pragmatron.org/docs/sparqlsphere.html">SparqlSphere</a>. <a href="http://ideagraph.net/">IdeaGraph</a> is a long-term project to develop
a <em>desktop</em> Personal Knowledge Management application. This is
currently on pause while I'm experimenting with server-side components.
Associated with these projects I have various <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a>/<a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/">OWL</a> vocabularies (at various
stages of incompleteness) for various specific purposes, such as online <a href="http://www.purl.org/stuff/rev">Reviews</a> and <a href="http://ideagraph.net/xmlns/project/">Project Management</a>. I've also
done some work on an <a href="http://dannyayers.com/2004/02/atom/index.html">OWL Ontology for
Atom</a>, and some <a href="http://semtext.org/pets/pet-a-matic.htm">stuff</a> for putting pets
(like <a href="http://dannyayers.com/pets/basil/profile.xml">Basil</a>) on
the Semantic Web.</p>

<p>Once these parts are at a reasonably well-developed stage, I want to spend
time exploring techniques for combining Semantic Web and machine learning
technologies to autodiscover connections between ideas. This isn't much more
than a few loose ideas at present (with working titles like "SemText" and
"Serendipity Server"), partly because a lot of experimentation will be needed
to see what works. Tools suitable for fusing logic-based inference and
statistical techniques in the (Semantic) Web environment aren't yet
available, but are on the to-do list.</p>

<p>At any given time I've usually got half-a-dozen different little hacks in
progress. As time permits I've been putting together a graph-oriented RDF
API, "<a href="http://dannyayers.com/archives/002411.html">Sambuca</a>" the
target language is Smalltalk (for <a href="http://www.squeak.org/">Squeak</a>), though I somehow find myself
hacking in Python at the moment. Ah well, port later. At some point I'm
hoping to do some experimentation around <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/">WordNet</a> for the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/BestPractices/WNET/tf">WordNet Task
Force</a>, although I'm still trying to get up to speed on the background.
I'm always in the process of reorganising my online material. The main thing
outstanding is to collate links to hacks and written material - a while ago I
made a start with <a href="http://dannyayers.com/delivered.htm">Delivered</a>
and <a href="http://dannyayers.com/cooking.htm">In Progress</a>, but recently most hacky
things have been posted on my <a href="http://dannyayers.com/">weblog</a> but
not catalogued elsewhere. To-do.</p>

<p>When funds are low I generally do contract development/programming and
consultancy work.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Technical Writing</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Recently finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764579169">Beginning RSS and
Atom Programming</a> for Wrox/Wiley, co-authored with <a href="http://www.tfosorcim.org/blog/">Andrew Watt</a> (see also: <a href="#published">Published Work</a>).</p>

<p>I've usually got a handful of short pieces on the go, with the hope I can
get paid for one or two of them. Output includes <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/07/23/extendingrss.html">Extending
RSS</a> and <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/11/19/svgwiki.html">Creating an SVG
Wiki</a> (both at <a href="http://xml.com/">xml.com</a>) and <a href="http://dannyayers.com/2003/musings/view-source.htm">The Legend of View Source</a> (on
this site). I have worked on <a href="#published">several other books</a>. I
was recently interviewed on <a href="http://inkblots.markwoodman.com/rss-diaries/danny-ayers">RSS in the
Enterprise</a>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Community Work</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm involved in various online collaborative projects notably:</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of witnessing the transformation of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/Interest/">RDF Interest Group</a> into the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/interest/">Semantic Web Interest Group</a> at
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/interest/meetings/tp2004">W3C
plenary</a> in Cannes, France 2004, where I also gave a lightning talk. I
gave an invited talk at <a href="http://semanticweb.deit.univpm.it/">SWAP2004</a> (Italian Workshop on
Semantic Web Applications and Perspectives, Ancona University) and am on the
programme commitee for SWAP2005. I was also on the programme commitee for <a href="http://www.semanticscripting.org/SFSW2005/">SFSW2005</a> (Workshop on
Scripting for the Semantic Web, European Semantic Web Conference 2005).</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Weblogs</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I've had a <a href="http://dannyayers.com/">personal blog</a> for several
years. I tend to post a lot on Semantic Web-related matters, and the blog is
one of those aggregated on <a href="http://planetrdf.com/">Planet RDF</a>,
despite (or maybe because of) the numerous <a href="http://dannyayers.com/archives/category/physical-world/nice-looking-creatures/">cat
photos</a>. I maintain the <a href="http://danja.typepad.com/fecho">Finally
Atom</a> weblog, keeping track of developments in the <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/FrontPage">Atom</a> syndication
format/protocol project. I'm the primary contributor to a professional blog
focussing on Grid computing: <a href="http://gridreporter.com/">GridReporter.com</a>. I'm a very occasional
contributor to <a href="http://lambda.weblogs.com/">Lambda the Ultimate</a>
<em>the</em> programming languages weblog (usually when a new<em></em> RDF
serialization appears).</p>

<h3>Personal Stuff</h3>

<p>I live in northern Italy with my wife Caroline. We're originally from the
<a href="http://www.cressbrook.co.uk/">Peak District</a> in northern England,
(she from <a href="http://www.cressbrook.co.uk/bakewell.htm">Bakewell</a>, me
from <a href="http://www.tideswellonline.com/html/about.htm">Tidza</a> ). We
lived in <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/indian_subcontinent/sri_lanka/">Sri
Lanka</a> for a while before settling here. We've got a dog and six cats (a
lot I know, but they adopted us).</p>

<p>You'll have gathered I'm a developer, tech author and consultant, on
forward-looking Web technologies. I <em>enjoy</em> this stuff<a></a>.</p>

<p>I also enjoy making electronic music, but haven't done any for a long time
(I was a founder member of <a href="http://www.earthlydelights.co.uk/discog.html">Nocturnal Emissions</a>,
way back). I very much like carving wood, and since being near the Carrera
marble quarries (as in the photo above) I've started trying stone. I'll have
another crack at oil painting when time permits, it seems you need practice
to get beyond blobby trees. I'm not remotely athletic but did try skiing
once, a lot of fun despite the bruises. We usually just plod up hills on
foot, being dragged by Basil dog.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Some History</strong></li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://dannyayers.com/misc/about/pet.htm">My first computer was one of
these:</a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://dannyayers.com/misc/about/pet.htm"><img src="biog_files/commodore_pet2001_tiny.gif" title="My first computer, a PET 2001" alt="little old computer" border="0" width="60" height="53"></a></p>

<p>I've been interested in knowledge representation and machine learning for
many years and have worked for several years on network technologies. I'm
delighted to see these fields are now converging before my very eyes, in the
form of the Web, soon to be formerly known as the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">Semantic Web</a>. I got interested in these
particular technologies while trying to build a smarter search engine, quite
<a href="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind9906&amp;L=rdf-dev&amp;P=R21&amp;I=-1">a
while ago</a> now.</p>

<p>I'm active on the Web. The earliest material of mine still live I believe
is <a href="http://www.telephone.demon.co.uk/">this</a> from around 1996.
Most things pass through the <a href="http://dannyayers.com/">blog</a> these
days (my earliest bloglike post is probably this <a href="http://dannyayers.com/isacat/lanka/pp0.htm">postcard</a> from around
1999/2000).</p>

<p>I haven't really got any paper qualifications, though I had 2 years
studying electronics for the music industry (HND level) and a one-year degree
course at Sheffield Hallam University on Engineering Information Technology,
really enjoying the digital signals material but flunking the finals on
analogue circuit theory. I've also done some of a part-time MSc in Computing
for Commerce and Industry with the Open University, although that's become
totally redundant with the work I've been doing since.</p>

<p>My last full-time day job was about 5 years ago at the University of
Derby's <a href="http://www.highpeak.ac.uk/">Buxton Campus</a> (High Peak
College), where for around 4 years my primary responsibility was looking
after a network (Netware, NT and my pet Linux box) serving several hundred
staff and several thousand students. The IT department was a very small team,
so I was also on call for end-user support (I still cringe when the phone
rings). At one point I had the pleasure of redesigning the whole server
configuration essentially single-handedly, I also put together the College's
first Intranet and was behind their initial presence on the Web. Around the
same period I was an invited speaker at the <a href="http://www.mumjava.com/default.asp">MumJava Conference</a> in Mumbai
(Bombay), India. I also did a little teaching at the College, basic Web stuff
and Java.</p>

<p>I've tech reviewed a <em>lot</em> more.</p>

<p>Invited article for the <a href="http://www.sigsemis.org/">AIS

and why I think the W3C's <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">Sematic
Web</a> initiative is probably the best way forward to a better Web.</p>

<p>I've done a couple of short pieces for O'Reilly's <a href="http://www.xml.com/">xml.com</a> : <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/07/23/extendingrss.html">Extending

<p>In the days before the Web I had several articles published in the
magazine "Electronics World &amp; Wireless World" - on or roundabout
non-linear circuitry. These included a write-up on how easy it was for
circuits to get chaotic, and a bat detector. Two of these articles appeared
as the cover feature of the magazine.</p>
