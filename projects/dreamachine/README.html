<p><em>a flashy-light trippy thing</em></p>

<p>Here's a <a href="https://hyperdata.it/blog/2022/08/12/dreamachine-1/">blog post</a> with some background.</p>

<p>The plan is to make a <em>personal</em> version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamachine">Dreamachine</a>, a "stroboscopic flickering light art device that produces eidetic visual stimuli".</p>

<p>It has sunglasses-mounted LEDs, audio output for headphones (TODO), with two rotary encoders and a tiny LCD display for control. It will have audio output for headphones, providing modulated white/pink noise.</p>

<p>The device is being built around the ESP32 microcontroller module, hardware currently on a breadboard. For software development I'm using PlatformIO (on VSCode on Ubuntu).</p>

<p>I'm organising notes as I go along, the raw material is in <a href="https://github.com/danja/dreamachine/blob/main/devlog.md">devlog.md</a>, wiring in <a href="https://github.com/danja/dreamachine/blob/main/design/wiring.md">wiring.md</a>, parts list in <a href="https://github.com/danja/dreamachine/blob/main/design/components.md">components.md</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2022-08-12</strong> The hardware, except for audio-related, is assembled and tested. I've a reasonable plan for functionality, see <a href="https://github.com/danja/dreamachine/blob/main/design/requirements.md">requirements.md</a>. I've got the skeleton of software together with basic interfaces for the LED lights, rotary encoders and display. I wasn't happy with an off-the shelf rotary encoder library so I've been rewriting that : <a href="https://github.com/danja/Esp32RotaryEncoder">Esp32RotaryEncoder</a>. That still needs a bit of work but is basically working, good enough to proceed.</p>

<p>Detailed status is in <a href="https://github.com/danja/dreamachine/blob/main/devlog.md">devlog.md</a>.</p>
