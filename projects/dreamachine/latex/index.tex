This is documentation for Adafruit\textquotesingle{}s SSD1306 library for monochrome OLED displays\+: \href{http://www.adafruit.com/category/63_98}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+adafruit.\+com/category/63\+\_\+98}}

These displays use I2C or SPI to communicate. I2C requires 2 pins (SCL+\+SDA) and optionally a RESET pin. SPI requires 4 pins (MOSI, SCK, select, data/command) and optionally a reset pin. Hardware SPI or \textquotesingle{}bitbang\textquotesingle{} software SPI are both supported.
